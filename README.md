# MyCard
This is the virtual card explaining who I am. This is also one of my very firsts projects for Android :)
It is very simple but useful I believe. It is fully functional - you can cklick on buttons and it will take you to the website, 
you can cklick on email and it will prompt you to send an email. 
If someone would be surprised why I have holidays picture for a professional app - this is because I believe that if you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life (as someone before me said).
Thank you!
